// Create a class that has as a data member a 2D array of ints, and an int member for the dimension.
// The class constructor should take an integer, n, and create and instantiate the array with 0s in each “cell”. (Save “n” in the “dimension” data variable.
// In the constructor, catch Array Index out of bounds.
// In the client (main), create an instance of the class. Surround it in a try-catch block that checks for mathematical errors (ArithmeticException) and also generic exceptions (2 catches).
// Use a finally block to print out the dimensions of the array (nicely - don’t just print out n.)
// Test your code out to make sure your exceptions are caught.
